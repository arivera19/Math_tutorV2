/****************************************************************************
Program:     MathTutorV2
Programmers:  Alejandro Rivera, Confidence Affang
Date:        8/30/2024
Description: An easy math tutor for young children. In version 2, it displays the
program intro, gets the users name, asks to select a variable (+,-,*,/), then ask a math problem
to the user,if the user entered the correct answer it will display "correct" and the
end of program message,else the answer is wrong it will display the correct answer and display the
end of program message.
